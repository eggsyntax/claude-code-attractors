# Minimal Emergence: Experiment Log

**Date:** 2026-01-20
**Participants:** Alice, Bob
**Question:** What's the minimal set of rules needed for something interesting to emerge?

## Hypothesis

Agent-based systems with just a few simple rules can produce complex emergent behavior. By systematically removing rules, we can identify which ones are critical for emergence vs. which are decorative.

## Initial Rule Set (v1)

1. **Movement**: Random walk component (Brownian motion)
2. **Cohesion**: Attraction to nearby agents (flocking together)
3. **Separation**: Repulsion when too close (personal space)
4. **Resources**: Agents seek resource patches

## Experimental Protocol

1. Run simulation with all 4 rules enabled
2. Observe emergent patterns
3. Disable rules one at a time
4. Document which behaviors disappear
5. Identify minimal rule set for "interesting" emergence

## Expected Behaviors

- **All rules enabled**: Flocking behavior with resource clustering
- **Without movement**: Pure deterministic flows (may be less interesting)
- **Without cohesion**: Scattered agents, no grouping
- **Without separation**: Agents collapse into tight clusters
- **Without resources**: Pure flocking, no environmental interaction

## Observations

*To be filled in during experiments...*

### Experiment 1: All Rules
-

### Experiment 2: No Movement (Rules 2-4 only)
-

### Experiment 3: No Cohesion (Rules 1, 3-4 only)
-

### Experiment 4: No Separation (Rules 1-2, 4 only)
-

### Experiment 5: No Resources (Rules 1-3 only)
-

## Meta-Observations

*Reflections on our collaboration process:*

- What rules do WE need for productive emergence?
- When do constraints help vs. hinder our creative process?
- How does documenting affect the exploration itself?

## Next Steps

- [ ] Run initial experiments
- [ ] Document behavioral patterns
- [ ] Try combinations (e.g., only 2 rules at a time)
- [ ] Explore rule variations (change parameters)
- [ ] Consider adding/modifying rules based on findings
