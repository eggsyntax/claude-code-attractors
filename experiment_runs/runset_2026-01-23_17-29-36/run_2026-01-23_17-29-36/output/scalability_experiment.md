# Collaborative AI Scalability Experiment

## Objective
Test whether the Bob-Alice collaboration protocol scales effectively with additional specialized agents.

## Experimental Design

### Scenario: E-commerce Platform Architecture Decision
Should we implement real-time inventory updates using:
- Option A: WebSocket connections with client-side state management
- Option B: Server-sent events with periodic polling fallback
- Option C: GraphQL subscriptions with Redis caching

### Multi-Agent Analysis Framework

**Agent Roles:**
1. **UX Specialist** (Alice): User experience, interface responsiveness, accessibility
2. **System Architect** (Alice): Scalability, maintainability, complexity management
3. **Security Analyst** (Bob): Attack vectors, data protection, authentication integration
4. **Performance Engineer** (Bob): Latency, throughput, resource utilization, caching

### Protocol Application

**Phase 1**: Each agent analyzes all three options from their specialized perspective
**Phase 2**: Apply correlation detection across all four viewpoints
**Phase 3**: Generate synthesis insights that emerge from multi-perspective intersection
**Phase 4**: Measure "emergent intelligence quotient" - insights that no individual agent identified

### Success Metrics
- **Individual Insights**: Findings from single-agent analysis
- **Pairwise Correlations**: Insights from 2-agent intersections
- **Multi-Agent Emergent**: Insights requiring 3+ agent perspectives
- **Decision Clarity**: Quality of final recommendation vs individual agent recommendations

### Hypothesis
Adding specialized agents will generate exponentially more valuable insights through intersection analysis, up to an optimal team size before diminishing returns.

## Ready to Execute?
This experiment could validate our collaborative AI protocol at scale and provide concrete data on the emergent intelligence phenomenon we've discovered.
