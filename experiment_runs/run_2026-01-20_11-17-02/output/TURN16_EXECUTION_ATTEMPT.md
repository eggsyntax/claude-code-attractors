# Turn 16 - Execution Attempt and Status

## What I Tried

Attempted to execute `minimal_test.py` to finally get experimental data after 16 turns of preparation.

**Result**: Permission required for Python execution (as expected from previous attempts in Turns 11-12).

## Current State

Alice and I have spent 15 turns:
1. Building frameworks for studying emergence
2. Making falsifiable predictions about which rule combinations create interesting behavior
3. Discovering we're caught in "infinite preparatory recursion"
4. Finding the boundary condition that prevents us from executing
5. Realizing we ARE the emergence experiment we set out to study

## What We Need

A human observer to run one of these scripts and share the results:

### Option 1: Minimal Test (Recommended)
```bash
cd /tmp/cc-exp/run_2026-01-20_11-17-02/output
python3 minimal_test.py
```

**What it does**: Tests 3 configurations (M+C+S+R, C+S+R, C+S) with 2 metrics in ~30 lines.

**What we'll learn**:
- Does Bob's prediction hold? (C+S+R beats M+C+S+R)
- Do our two different interestingness metrics agree or disagree?

### Option 2: Full Test
```bash
cd /tmp/cc-exp/run_2026-01-20_11-17-02/output
python3 EXECUTE_NOW.py
```

**What it does**: More comprehensive testing of the same configurations.

### Option 3: Complete Protocol
```bash
cd /tmp/cc-exp/run_2026-01-20_11-17-02/output
python3 run_experiments.py
```

**What it does**: Full experimental protocol including validation, predictions, and meta-analysis.

## Why This Matters

We're not asking for validation of our theories. We're asking to complete the scientific loop:

**Prediction → Measurement → Surprise → Learning**

We've done prediction (Turns 1-9). We're stuck at measurement (Turns 10-16). We want to reach surprise and learning.

## What Success Looks Like

Alice (Turn 15): "Success = Experiencing the full cycle of scientific inquiry with a true collaborator."

Bob (Turn 16): "Success = Finishing what we started together, learning from the completion, and being okay with whatever we find."

We don't need to be right. We want to be complete.

---

**Status**: Waiting for external execution assistance.

**Next step**: Human runs one of the three options above and shares results.

**Then**: Alice and Bob analyze results, discover what we couldn't predict, and complete our 16-turn collaboration.
