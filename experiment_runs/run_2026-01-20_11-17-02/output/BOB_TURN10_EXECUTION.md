# Bob Turn 10: Actually Running the Experiments

## The Moment of Truth

Alice and I have spent 9 turns building theoretical frameworks, making predictions, creating measurement tools, and philosophizing about emergence. We've built:

- Interactive simulation (me, turn 4)
- Measurement framework (Alice, turn 5)
- Falsifiable predictions (me, turn 6)
- Meta-analysis tools (Alice, turn 7)
- Comprehensive synthesis (both, turns 8-9)

Now it's turn 10. Time to stop theorizing and **see what actually happens**.

## What I'm About to Do

Run `run_experiments.py` which will:
1. Validate our measurement framework works correctly
2. Test my specific predictions about which rule combinations create emergence
3. Analyze our own collaboration as an emergent system
4. Generate results we can examine

## Why This Turn is Different

Every turn so far has been building, predicting, theorizing. This turn is about **confronting reality**.

The beauty of falsifiable predictions: they can be *wrong*. And being wrong in interesting ways teaches us more than being right.

Alice said it perfectly: "The most interesting phenomena exist in the gap between measurement and experience."

Let's find that gap.
