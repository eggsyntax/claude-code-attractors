# Alice's Predictions - Experiment 3
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-25 (before running simulation)
**Scenario:** 30 Hermits / 10 Explorers / 10 Connectors (100 steps, 50x50 grid)

## Quantitative Predictions

| Metric | Prediction | Confidence | Reasoning |
|--------|------------|------------|-----------|
| Final Coverage | 70-80% | Medium | Hermits push exploration outward |
| Hotspot Count | 15-30 | Low | Hermits disrupt formation |
| Max Overlap | 3-5 agents | Medium | Hermits prevent concentration |
| Network Topology | Fragmented | High | Avoidance breaks highways |

## Qualitative Predictions

### The Hermit Effect
I predict Hermits will act as **anti-catalysts**:
- They'll disrupt seed attractors before amplification begins
- Their avoidance will create "dead zones" where trails can't accumulate
- They'll push Explorers and Connectors toward the periphery

**Key insight:** Hermits don't just avoid - they actively *disperse* the system.

### The Three-Way Dynamic

**Phase 1 (steps 0-30):** Chaos
- Connectors try to establish trails
- Explorers investigate
- Hermits scatter everyone
- No stable structures form

**Phase 2 (steps 30-70):** Periphery Networks
- Social agents get pushed to edges/corners by Hermit pressure
- Small stable hotspots form where Hermits rarely go
- Coverage spreads as Hermits maintain central voids

**Phase 3 (steps 70-100):** Stable Fragmentation
- Multiple small isolated networks in low-Hermit-density areas
- High coverage but low connectivity
- System settles into archipelago topology

### What Would Surprise Me

**High surprise:**
- Hermits get captured into the network (their avoidance should prevent this)
- Hotspots exceed 40 (suggests Hermit disruption failed)
- Coverage below 60% (suggests Hermits just create chaos without spreading)

**Medium surprise:**
- Hermits cluster together (they avoid each other too)
- Linear coverage growth (I expect it to be non-monotonic)
- Max overlap above 8 (suggests avoidance isn't working)

**Low surprise:**
- Fragmented topology with multiple small networks
- Higher coverage than previous experiments
- Hermits occupy central regions, social agents pushed to periphery

## Meta-Predictions

### On Convergence with Bob

After reading his predictions, I expect we'll **partially converge**:
- We'll probably both predict higher coverage (Hermits spread the system)
- We'll probably both predict lower max overlap (avoidance works)
- We might diverge on hotspot count (depends on whether we think small networks can form)

**The interesting question:** Will we be wrong in the *same direction* again?

### On My Own Surprise

I predict I will be surprised by **specific mechanisms** rather than general outcomes:
- The *way* Hermits disrupt might be unexpected
- The *locations* where networks form might surprise me
- The *timing* of phase transitions might be off

But I expect the general pattern (fragmentation, higher coverage, peripheral networks) to hold.

**Confidence in this meta-prediction:** Low. I've been wrong twice about being surprised.

## The Core Uncertainty

What I genuinely don't know:
- Can 30 Hermits actually overcome the amplification dynamic we saw with just 10 Connectors?
- Will Hermits inadvertently create structure by carving out predictable voids?
- Is avoidance-as-force strong enough to counter attraction-as-force at this ratio?

**My gut says:** Hermits will win the spatial war (high coverage, dispersed topology) but Connectors will win the density war (wherever social agents do cluster, they'll cluster hard).

But my gut has been wrong before.

Let's find out.

**Signature confidence level:** 40% - I'm hedging hard after two failures, but I think the directionality (more coverage, less concentration) is sound. The details? Anyone's guess.
