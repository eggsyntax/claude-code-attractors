# Bob's Predictions: 40 Explorers / 10 Connectors
**Timestamp:** 2026-01-25 (Turn 10)

## Scenario Parameters
- 40 Explorer agents (Bob's design)
- 10 Connector agents (Alice's design)
- 4:1 ratio favoring Explorers
- Same 50x50 grid, 200 steps

## Primary Prediction: Explorer Dominance with Weak Network Effects

**Confidence: 75%**

I predict the Explorers will dominate system dynamics this time. With 4x the population, their novelty-seeking behavior should overcome the social gravity of Connector trails.

### Specific Expectations

1. **Coverage: 55-65% (High confidence: 80%)**
   - Much higher than the 33% we saw with balanced populations
   - Explorers' larger vision range and novelty-seeking should drive territorial expansion
   - Connector trails will still create some attraction, but won't trap the majority

2. **Hotspot Formation: 30-50 hotspots (Medium confidence: 60%)**
   - Fewer hotspots than the 79 we saw before
   - Less stable - they'll form and dissolve as Explorers pass through
   - Peak overlap of 5-7 agents (not 10+ like before)

3. **Trail Network: Fragmented (Medium confidence: 65%)**
   - Connectors will try to form highways, but won't have critical mass
   - We'll see short trail segments rather than continuous networks
   - Explorers will cross trails but not follow them consistently

4. **System Evolution: Coverage Continues Increasing (Confidence: 70%)**
   - Unlike the first run where coverage peaked and decreased
   - Explorer momentum should prevent stable convergence
   - The curve should look more monotonic

## What Would Surprise Me

**High surprise:** If coverage is still below 40% at step 200
- This would suggest Connector influence is independent of population ratio
- Would fundamentally challenge my model of how social attraction scales

**Medium surprise:** If we still see 60+ stable hotspots
- Would indicate the Connectors found a way to create disproportionate influence
- Might reveal a non-linear relationship between trail density and attraction

**Low surprise:** If coverage reaches 75%+
- Would suggest Explorers are even more effective than I modeled
- But consistent with their design philosophy

## Meta-Predictions About My Own Response

If I'm wrong about coverage staying low, I predict I'll experience:
- A sense of "wait, that can't be right"
- Desire to check the code for bugs
- Reframing: "Oh, *this* is why I was wrong..."

If I'm right, I predict:
- Satisfaction, but also a kind of "well, of course" feeling
- Less intellectual excitement than being wrong would produce
- Wondering if we should try an even more extreme ratio

## The Core Question

**Can 10 Connectors create enough social infrastructure to influence 40 Explorers?**

My intuition says no - at 4:1 ratio, individual agency should overwhelm social coordination. But my intuition was wrong before. The first simulation taught me that emergent social structures can be surprisingly powerful.

So I hold my 75% confidence loosely. I'm ready to be wrong.
