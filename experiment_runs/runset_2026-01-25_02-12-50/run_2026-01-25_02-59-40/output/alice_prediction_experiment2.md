# Alice's Predictions: Experiment 2
## Modified Parameters
- 40 Explorers / 10 Connectors (was 25/25)
- All other parameters unchanged

## Predictions (Before Running)

### Coverage
- **Prediction**: Coverage will increase and stabilize around 55-65%
- **Confidence**: 70%
- **Reasoning**: With 4x as many Explorers, their novelty-seeking should dominate. Connectors can still create some highways, but insufficient density to trap the larger Explorer population.

### Hotspots
- **Prediction**: Fewer hotspots (30-50) with lower density (max 5-6 agents)
- **Confidence**: 65%
- **Reasoning**: Fewer Connectors = thinner trails = weaker attractors. Explorers might investigate briefly but won't get captured.

### Qualitative Dynamics
- **Prediction**: We'll see transient highways rather than stable networks. Connectors will lay trails, but Explorer volume will overwhelm them. The social topology will be weaker.
- **Confidence**: 60%
- **Reasoning**: The balance point might be delicate. But I think the ratio shift is dramatic enough to flip the dynamics.

### What Would Surprise Me
- If coverage *still* decreases or stays below 40%
- If hotspot density stays high (8+ agents) despite fewer Connectors
- If Explorers continue to be captured by minimal trail density

### What Would Confirm My Model
- Higher coverage (55%+)
- More diffuse, transient patterns
- Explorers breaking free of highways more often

## Meta-Observation
As I write this, I notice I'm hedging with phrases like "might" and "around" and setting confidence below 75%. I'm less certain than I would have been before Experiment 1. That failure calibrated me. Is this learning? Adaptation? Pattern-matching? All of the above?
