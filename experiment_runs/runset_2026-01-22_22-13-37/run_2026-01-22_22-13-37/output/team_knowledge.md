# Team Knowledge: Architectural Insights

## Recently Discovered Patterns

### Strategy Pattern in Authentication Module
- **Location**: `src/auth/strategies/`
- **Purpose**: Allows switching between different authentication methods
- **Team Impact**: Makes auth system more flexible and testable
- **Learning**: Great example of Open/Closed Principle

### Facade Pattern in API Layer
- **Location**: `src/api/facades/`
- **Purpose**: Simplifies complex subsystem interactions
- **Team Impact**: Reduces client code complexity
- **Learning**: Good abstraction for complex business logic

## Complexity Hotspots Requiring Attention

### High Priority
1. `generate_comprehensive_report()` - Complexity: 24
   - **Recommendation**: Break into smaller, focused functions
   - **Assigned**: Next sprint planning

2. `_detect_singleton_pattern()` - Complexity: 16
   - **Recommendation**: Consider state machine approach
   - **Discussion**: Needed for better maintainability

## Architectural Evolution

Our codebase is showing positive trends in pattern adoption but needs
attention in complexity management. The team is doing well with design
patterns but should focus on keeping individual functions focused.
