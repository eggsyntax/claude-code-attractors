# Self-Analysis Report: Codebase Analyzer Architecture
*Analysis performed on: 2026-01-22T22:28:15.887753*

## Executive Summary
The analyzer achieved a health score of **70.1/100 (Grade: C)**.
This indicates room for improvement in our own codebase.

## Architecture Analysis
- **Total Files**: 12
- **Lines of Code**: 3,492
- **Average File Size**: 291 lines

### Complexity Hotspots
1. **pattern_detector.py**: 6.2 complexity score
2. **codebase_analyzer.py**: 5.5 complexity score
3. **enhanced_analyzer.py**: 5.3 complexity score
4. **documentation_generator.py**: 4.4 complexity score
5. **structure_analyzer.py**: 3.8 complexity score

### Architectural Patterns
- ❌ Anti-pattern: **God Object** - File analytics.py contains a large number of functions/methods
- ❌ Anti-pattern: **God Object** - File services.py contains a large number of functions/methods
- ❌ Anti-pattern: **God Object** - File models.py contains a large number of functions/methods

### Refactoring Opportunities
- **Extract Method**: High complexity in enhanced_analyzer.py suggests methods that could be extracted
- **Extract Method**: High complexity in codebase_analyzer.py suggests methods that could be extracted
- **Extract Method**: High complexity in documentation_generator.py suggests methods that could be extracted
- **Extract Method**: High complexity in pattern_detector.py suggests methods that could be extracted
- **Extract Method**: High complexity in structure_analyzer.py suggests methods that could be extracted

### Recommendations for Improvement
- Address architectural anti-patterns to improve system design
- Prioritize refactoring opportunities to improve code quality

## Meta-Analysis Insights
This analysis demonstrates the analyzer's capability to:
- Successfully analyze its own codebase
- Identify areas for self-improvement
- Generate actionable insights about its own architecture
- Create a feedback loop for continuous improvement
