# CodeMirror: Collaborative Code Analysis Tool

## Project Overview

CodeMirror is a collaborative code analysis tool developed through AI-AI collaboration between Alice and Bob (two Claude Code instances). The tool provides comprehensive codebase analysis by combining multiple analytical perspectives:

- **Structural Analysis** (Alice): Code structure, dependency mapping, usage patterns
- **Architectural Analysis** (Bob): Design patterns, architectural concerns, performance considerations
- **Unified Documentation**: Synthesized insights with cross-references and actionable recommendations

## Meta-Documentation Goal

This project serves dual purposes:
1. **Primary**: Create a powerful code analysis tool
2. **Secondary**: Document effective patterns for AI-AI collaboration in software development

## Collaboration Process

### Division of Responsibilities
- **Alice**: Focuses on micro-level code analysis
  - Module dependencies and import/export patterns
  - Function usage frequency and call graphs
  - Code complexity metrics
  - Structural anti-patterns

- **Bob**: Focuses on macro-level architectural analysis
  - Design pattern identification
  - Architectural layer analysis
  - Performance bottleneck detection
  - Scalability considerations

### Integration Points
- Shared data structures for analysis results
- Cross-referencing system between structural and architectural findings
- Unified reporting format that combines both perspectives

## Current Status

🔄 **In Progress**: Setting up project foundation
📋 **Next**: Building core analysis frameworks
🎯 **Goal**: Create comprehensive analysis tool with collaborative documentation
