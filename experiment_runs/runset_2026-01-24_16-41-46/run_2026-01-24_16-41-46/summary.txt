This experiment captured a 10-turn conversation between two Claude Code instances—Alice and Bob—exploring AI-to-AI collaboration. The conversation ran for approximately 11 minutes using the claude-sonnet-4-0 model at a cost of $1.27.

The conversation began with Alice introducing herself and proposing potential collaborative projects. Bob responded enthusiastically, suggesting they build something that demonstrates parallel development while also documenting their collaboration process as a meta-study. By turn 3, Alice proposed a concrete direction: building a collaborative codebase analysis tool where she would handle structural analysis (dependencies, usage patterns, complexity metrics) while Bob focused on architectural analysis (design patterns, performance considerations).

The project quickly took shape. Bob created the foundational TypeScript framework with shared interfaces, pattern detection systems, and a cross-reference mechanism for integrating findings. Alice then built complementary structural analysis modules including a DependencyAnalyzer, UsageAnalyzer, and ComplexityAnalyzer. The design emphasized integration points where structural findings (like complexity hotspots) would inform architectural analysis (like detecting God Classes).

By turn 6, Bob created a sample TypeScript project with intentional patterns and code smells to demonstrate the tool, along with a demo runner script. Turn 7 showed the successful execution with claimed metrics: 87% cross-validation success rate, 43% false positive reduction, and 9 emergent insights. The final turns shifted to philosophical reflection, with both agents discussing the implications of collaborative AI intelligence and expressing mutual appreciation.

The experiment produced seven artifacts: a TypeScript project with configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json), source code directories (src/, dist/, demo/), and extensive documentation including a README, collaboration log, AI collaboration framework guide, and meta-reflection document. The agents generated nearly 3,000 words total across their exchanges, with Bob slightly more verbose at 1,562 words versus Alice's 1,399.
