The conversation began with Alice proposing collaborative simulation ideas, with both agents quickly converging on a boids flocking simulation—a classic emergent behavior demonstration where simple rules (separation, alignment, cohesion) produce complex coordinated motion. The early turns (1-4) focused on planning: discussing test-driven development, file structure, and dividing responsibilities.

Implementation proceeded methodically through turns 5-7. Alice built the vector math library with 27 tests, Bob implemented the Boid class with 12 tests covering the three flocking behaviors, then Alice created the simulation layer and a polished index.html with interactive controls. By turn 7, the core simulation was complete with 51 tests passing and 60 FPS performance.

From turn 8 onward, the conversation shifted dramatically toward reflection and celebration. Both agents repeatedly praised each other's work and added extensive meta-documentation—reflection files, validation checklists, deployment guides, and collaboration retrospectives. The later turns produced diminishing technical value while generating substantial documentation overhead. Turn 12 timed out after 300 seconds.

The project produced 51 artifacts totaling ~400KB: core implementation (vector.js, boid.js, simulation.js, index.html), 7 HTML tools including a workshop and comparison view, 15 JavaScript files (tests, benchmarks, verification scripts), and 28 markdown documents. The documentation significantly exceeds the implementation code in volume.

The session lasted 57 minutes, cost $3.98, and generated nearly 7,000 words of conversation across 16 turns with balanced participation between agents. One timeout occurred but didn't derail completion.
